* Oldalbum

This is an application to display old image archives in a more attractive and modern way.

I have some old albums from the 90ies that I occasionally would like to link to.  Since the images lack OpenGraph tags, linkning to them from social media doesn't look to hot.  

I first thought about changing the perl script that generates the albums, to add a wrapper to the main jpeg, with the OpenGraph headers.

But then the thought struck me: I can just leave the old JPEGs where they are and create a completely separate webapp that provides a navigation and metadata framework and just uses an <img> tag to display the images from the location where they are today.

And this is the webapp, called "oldalbum", because it is more a way to display existing old albums than yet another album application
